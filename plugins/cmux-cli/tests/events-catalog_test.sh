# Regression guard: the `cmux events` documentation stays true.
#
# The skill now routes waiting and send-verification through `cmux events`
# instead of read-screen forensics, which makes three things load-bearing:
#
#   1. events.md documents the event names the SKILL.md recipes actually name.
#      A doc edit that drops workspace.prompt.submitted or agent.hook.Stop
#      silently strands the recipe that depends on it.
#   2. events.md's invocation contract matches the installed CLI's flags.
#      The recipes pass --no-ack/--no-heartbeat/--timeout/--after for stated
#      reasons; if any of those stop existing, the recipes are wrong.
#   3. Every event name cmux actually emits is one we document. This direction
#      is deliberate: a live replay on a quiet machine will not contain all 30
#      names, so "documented ⊆ observed" would fail spuriously. "observed ⊆
#      documented" instead catches cmux ADDING a name we haven't written up.
#
# Parts 2 and 3 need real cmux and self-skip without it. Part 1 is pure text
# and runs everywhere, CI included.

# TWO SAMPLES, AND ONLY THEIR INTERSECTION CAN FAIL THE SUITE.
#
# This part reads the REAL cmux stream, which is the only thing that can catch a
# name cmux has started emitting that events.md does not document — the whole
# reason it is not a static doc check. The cost is that its input is live state:
# it failed inside a full `run-all` while a second `run-all` was running and
# passed alone moments later, so as a single sample it reports the machine's
# recent history as if it were a property of this change-set.
#
# The fix is reproducibility, not a wider window. A name present in TWO
# independent replays taken seconds apart is a real gap in the doc and fails; a
# name present in only one is reported and does not, because that is the shape of
# buffer contention, a rolling window dropping frames under load, and the
# retained replay's own habit of not reaching the newest frames. Widening the
# window would have made a flake rarer without making it wrong less often, and
# serializing the suite would have fixed nothing about a name that is simply new.
#
# Each replay is bounded: --timeout exits 1 once the retained buffer is drained,
# which is the normal end of one here rather than a failure, and stderr stays out
# of the file so jq never sees the timeout line.
