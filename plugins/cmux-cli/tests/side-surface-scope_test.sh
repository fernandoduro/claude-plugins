# =============================================================================
# open-side-surface.sh: `new-surface` always carries the container.
#
# `cmux new-surface` scopes its --pane lookup to --workspace, which defaults to
# $CMUX_WORKSPACE_ID — and that scoping applies to a pane UUID exactly as it
# does to a positional `pane:N`. A valid UUID in another workspace comes back
# `not_found: Pane not found`, which hotline's cmux-call-async.sh reads as the
# documented degrade, so every side-by-side dial from an agent-spawned session
# opened a detached tab instead. The shim below models that real scoping: a
# `new-surface` whose workspace is not the subject's is rejected the way cmux
# rejects it, so these cases fail if the opener ever stops pinning the context.
#
# Both directions are fixtured on purpose. The bug was found via `identify`
# returning caller:null (the env surface and workspace disagree, so the tree
# fallback supplies the placement), but the missing flags were in a branch that
# a normal `identify` reaches too. (claude-plugins-qyj1)
#
# A tree whose pane `.id`s are null is fixtured too, because it reaches the
# other `new-surface` branch — the one that targets the positional `pane:N` —
# and because that is the shape where a container UUID packed into the pane
# TSV would shift into the `--pane` slot. Both are asserted by exact argv
# value, not by substring. A tree whose window `.id` is null covers the
# ref fallback for `--window`.
#
# One case covers a different failure in the same code path: cmux echoing a
# `surface:N` it then does not resolve in a tree read. The opener looks that ref
# up to trade it for UUIDs and names, and the `read` consuming that lookup is
# fatal under `set -euo pipefail` when it comes back empty — so the script
# aborted with rc=1, no stdout and no stderr, one line above the fallback
# written for exactly that case, taking hotline's whole cmux transport with it
# (`stage: boot`, `detail: "open-side-surface.sh failed (rc=1): "`). The guard
# is `|| true`; this is what proves it is still there. (claude-plugins-99nu,
# and the ledger's "guard a `read` that consumes a lookup" entry.)
#
# Driven entirely by a shimmed `cmux` on PATH — never touches real cmux.
