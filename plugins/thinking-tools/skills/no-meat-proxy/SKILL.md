# No Meat Proxy

JT is the one who would become the proxy, not you. He has to relay your output to people, in his own words, while multitasking. If he cannot, he either forwards your text verbatim (proxy) or drops it. Your job is to make the first thing he reads sayable out loud.

This is a rewrite instruction, not a research trigger. Do not investigate, verify further, or fetch anything when invoked. Verification already happened; this is about the words. Background reading: `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/nomeatproxy.md` (the site, inlined; Codex: the `references/` directory beside this `SKILL.md`). Never fetch the site.

## The test

Cover everything but the visible part. Could JT turn to a teammate and explain it in two sentences? If not, rewrite.

## Rules for the visible part

- **Plain nouns only.** No agent-coined terms. If a word did not exist in the repo or the conversation before this work started ("satellite", "handoff", "gate", "ledger" used as a noun for a doc), you invented it: say what the thing IS instead ("the other repos", "the shared rulebook", "the final pass/fail").
- **No identifiers.** File paths, SHAs, exit codes, JSON keys, flag names, session IDs, comment IDs. Those go under a `<details>` fold or a linked file. One exception: a filename when the reader must open it.
- **Consequence first, mechanism never.** Say what happened and what it means for JT. How it works belongs in the fold.
- **Three to five sentences, or three bullets.** Longer means you have not decided what matters.
- **One action at the end.** Not a menu.

## The loop

1. Write the draft.
2. Read each sentence and ask: would JT say this word to a colleague at lunch? Swap or cut.
3. Move every identifier and every "how" sentence into the fold.
4. Re-read only the visible part. Apply the test. Repeat until it passes.

## What "verified" means here

Anything you did not check yourself gets one plain sentence saying so ("I did not run X"). No hedging adverbs, no "may".
