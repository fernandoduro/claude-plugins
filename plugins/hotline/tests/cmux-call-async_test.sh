# launcher must CHOOSE the fork's id up front via --session-id and record that
# as the preset. Verified against the live CLI:
#   claude --resume A --fork-session --session-id B   → transcript lands in B
#   claude --resume A --session-id B                  → hard error:

# wait-for-session.sh returned the wrong id and wait-for-response.sh polled the
# original session's transcript — reporting "the message never submitted" while
